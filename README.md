# OpenDataPhilly

[OpenDataPhilly](https://www.opendataphilly.org/) is a regional open data catalog, providing a repository for information about open data available from the City of Philadelphia, non-profit organizations, university research projects, and other publishers of open data about the region.

## Motivations for Open-Source Community

While most open data catalogs are maintained by a single government entity, we believe that a diverse array of open data is more useful to the community than many repositories with discrete collections. Azavea and Element 84 have provided support for OpenDataPhilly on a pro bono basis for more than a decade, but the acquisition of Azavea has highlighted the dependency on a single organizationâ€™s goodwill to sustain the project. In the long run, we seek to maintain the regional character of OpenDataPhilly, while growing the community of contributors to the project in order to improve resilience and sustainability of the effort.
